Welcome to the support guide! What type of help are you looking for?

## I need help understanding how the app works
If you want to learn how use a specific feature of the application, please see our [user guide](https://help.openboxes.com/), which describes the primary features of the app in non-technical terms.

## I need help running/deploying the app
Have you read through our [installation documentation](http://docs.openboxes.com/en/latest/installation/)? The documentation outlines all the steps that a system administrator should need to follow to install, configure, update, and deploy the application to a production server.

If you're running into an issue not described in our documentation, take a look through the [support forums](https://community.openboxes.com/) to see if someone has encountered a similar problem. If you're still stuck, we encourage you to create a new forum post. Please make sure to let us know the step of the installation process that you're stuck on.

## I think I found a bug in the app
If you've found a bug in OpenBoxes, take a look through the [existing reported issues](https://github.com/openboxes/openboxes/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported, and if not, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/openboxes/openboxes/issues/new).

If you've uncovered a security vulnerability in the app, we ask that instead of creating an issue, you please email us at support@openboxes.com with details about the vulnerability so that we can protect our user base.

When creating a new GitHub issue, be sure to add enough context in the issue description for the team to be able to properly investigate. At a minimum, please include the following:

1. The version of OpenBoxes you're using. You can find the version at the bottom of the webpage.
2. The operating system and browser you're using.
3. The steps you performed to produce the bug.
4. What you expected to see.
5. What you saw instead.
6. Screenshots and videos are extremely helpful! Please include some if possible.
