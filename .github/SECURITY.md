## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've uncovered a security vulnerability in the application, instead of creating a public GitHub Issue for it (which would inform potential attackers of the vulnerability), we ask that you please email us at support@openboxes.com with details about the vulnerability.

Thank you for helping make OpenBoxes safer for our users!
