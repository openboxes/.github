# Default Community Health Files

A special GitHub keyword repository containing the "Community Health" files (ie GitHub's special *.md files) for OpenBoxes.

Any files here are considered by GitHub as defaults for the organization. They will be visible in all OpenBoxes repositories unless the repository defines its own version of the file.
